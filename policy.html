      <h2>A. Shipping & Returns — <em>No Return Policy</em></h2>

      <h3>A.1 Summary</h3>
      <p>FASHION Store maintains a <strong>No Return Policy</strong> for most of our inventory. That means once an order is delivered and accepted by the customer, returns are not accepted except in very specific circumstances described below. We recommend that customers review product descriptions, sizing information and images carefully before placing an order.</p>

      <h3>A.2 Scope — when "No Return Policy" applies</h3>
      <p>This No Return Policy applies to standard retail purchases made on our website and mobile interfaces and includes all categories of products unless an item is explicitly marked as "eligible for returns" in the product description. Examples of products commonly covered by No Return Policy include: intimate apparel, personalized items, perishable goods, and clearance items. If an item is eligible for return the product page will show the return eligibility and timeframe.</p>

      <h3>A.3 Limited exceptions (when a return or exchange may be allowed)</h3>
      <p>While our default position is No Return, we will accept returns or exchanges in the following limited cases:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Manufacturing defects that are reported to us within <strong>7 calendar days</strong> of delivery.</li>
        <li>Wrong item shipped (we shipped different SKU than ordered).</li>
        <li>Item damaged in transit (visible damage to packaging or product upon delivery).</li>
        <li>Items covered by an explicit seller or brand warranty that includes return or exchange rights.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>To request a return under these exceptions you must contact our support team at <a href="mailto:sidharthvnair3@gmail.com">sidharthvnair3@gmail.com</a> within the stated timeframe and provide the required documentation (photos, order number, description). We will evaluate your claim and, if approved, provide a return authorization and instructions.</p>

      <h3>A.4 How to report a problem (required documentation)</h3>
      <p>If you believe your item qualifies for return or exchange under the exceptions above, please email <a href="mailto:sidharthvnair3@gmail.com">sidharthvnair3@gmail.com</a> with the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Your order number and date of purchase.</li>
        <li>Name and phone number used for the order.</li>
        <li>Description of the issue and the resolution you request (refund/exchange/repair).</li>
        <li>At least two clear photographs showing the problem (close-up and context shots) and a photograph of the shipping label if damaged.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>A.5 Inspection and approval process</h3>
      <p>Upon receiving your claim, we may ask you to ship the item back to us for inspection or provide additional evidence. If requested to ship the item, we will provide a prepaid shipping label only when we determine the return is due to our error (wrong item or defective item). For returns that are not our error, you may be responsible for return shipping costs and we may deduct reasonable shipping/handling fees from any refund.</p>

      <h3>A.6 Timeframe for approval and resolution</h3>
      <p>We will acknowledge receipt of your claim within <strong>3 business days</strong> and aim to complete inspections and notify you of the outcome within <strong>10 business days</strong>. If a physical return is required, the timeline may vary depending on shipping and inspection location.</p>

      <h3>A.7 Refunds & exchanges when approved</h3>
      <p>If a return or exchange is approved, we will process a refund to the original payment method within <strong>7–14 business days</strong> after we receive the returned goods (or after inspection if return shipping is not required). If an exchange is requested and approved, we will ship the replacement item using standard shipping at our discretion. Refund amounts may be reduced by restocking, shipping, or handling fees as disclosed during the return approval process.</p>

      <h3>A.8 Non-refundable items</h3>
      <p>Even when a return is accepted for limited exceptions, the following items are generally non-refundable unless explicitly stated otherwise: final sale items, items missing original packaging, washed or used items, items with tampered seals, and gift cards.</p>

      <h3>A.9 Cancellation policy</h3>
      <p>You may cancel an order within <strong>1 hour</strong> of placing it by contacting customer support. After that window, orders that have entered fulfillment cannot be canceled and become subject to the No Return Policy unless an exception applies.</p>

      <h3>A.10 Dispute resolution for returns</h3>
      <p>If you and we disagree about a return outcome, you may request escalation by emailing <a href="mailto:sidharthvnair3@gmail.com">sidharthvnair3@gmail.com</a>. We will assign a senior representative to review the case. Persistent disputes may be resolved by mediation or other remedies as set out under the Governing Law section of this document.</p>

    <section id="refund-policy">
      <h2>B. Refund Policy (detailed)</h2>
      <h3>B.1 When refunds are issued</h3>
      <p>Refunds are only issued when a return is approved under the limited exceptions described above, or if we are unable to deliver the goods and a refund is requested. Refunds may be issued as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Credit to the original payment method (preferred)</li>
        <li>Store credit or gift voucher (only with customer consent)</li>
        <li>Replacement item (exchange) where appropriate</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>B.2 Refund calculation</h3>
      <p>The refund amount will generally equal the purchase price of the returned items less any promotional discounts applied to the order, and less any non-refundable fees such as shipping and restocking where applicable. Taxes will be refunded where required by law.</p>

      <h3>B.3 Processing time</h3>
      <p>After a return is accepted and we receive the returned item, refunds are typically processed within 7–14 business days. The timing for the funds to appear in your account depends on the payment provider and bank.</p>

      <h3>B.4 Fraud prevention & reversals</h3>
      <p>We may delay or decline refunds if we reasonably suspect fraudulent activity, chargebacks, or misuse of our returns process. In cases of confirmed fraud, we reserve the right to recover funds by legal means.</p>

      <h3>B.5 Chargebacks</h3>
      <p>If you initiate a chargeback with your payment provider, please also notify us so we can investigate and respond. Unwarranted chargebacks may lead to account suspension and legal action.</p>
